# Inputs
This section describes the user inputs required to run the BuildStock Projections workflow. A typical run will include the following inputs provided by the user:

- Configuration file or CLI arguments [<sup>ðŸ”—</sup>](project_cfg)
- Initial buildstock.csv files and options_lookup.tsv file [<sup>ðŸ”—</sup>](buildstocks)
- Future population projections [<sup>ðŸ”—</sup>](population)
- New construction option files (*optional*) [<sup>ðŸ”—</sup>](building_options)
- Existing stock option files (*optional*) [<sup>ðŸ”—</sup>](building_options)

If running with a subset of PUMAs (not a full national scale), filter down the buildstock.csv to the desired region(s), and other inputs will automatically use just the available locations.
