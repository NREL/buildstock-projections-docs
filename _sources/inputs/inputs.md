# Inputs
This section describes the user inputs required to run the BuildStock Projections workflow. A typical run will include the following inputs provided by the user:

- Configuration file or CLI arguments [[LINK]](project_cfg)
- Initial buildstock.csv files and options_lookup.tsv file [[LINK]](buildstocks)
- Future population projections [[LINK]](population)
- New construction option files (*optional*) [[LINK]](building_options)
- Existing stock option files (*optional*) [[LINK]](building_options)

If running with a subset of PUMAs (not a full national scale), filter down the buildstock.csv to the desired region(s), and other inputs will automatically use just the available locations.
